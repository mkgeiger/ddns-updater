# ddns-updater

This sketch is implemented on an ESP32 Nodemcu module. It enables a cyclic update of the router's WAN-IP (the IP which is visible from the Web) with a DDNS (dynamic domain name service) provider. This is required when you want to reach your private server from the Web with a fixed domainname, because your WAN-IP is not static and is regularly reassigned (dynamic) to your router by your Internet provider from time to time. I have implemented this because most routers allow only configuring a few predefined DDNS providers, which are often also not free of charge. So I decided to extend this poor router feature with this external module. By holding the IO0-button pressed right after booting has been started, the SW is starting a webserver. In this mode the DDNS provider settings (e.g. DDNS provider, domain, user/token and password) can be configured and stored to persistent memory. In normal startup (not pressing the IO0-button) the SW updates at your chosen DDNS provider your domainname with your actual WAN-IP. The update cycle rate is hard coded and fixed to 10 minutes. Between 2 cycles the SW goes into deep sleep to rduce the power consumption. The DDNS client handling is managed with the EasyDNS library: https://github.com/ayushsharma82/EasyDDNS . Enjoy running any server (e.g. Webserver, Music-Server, NAS, etc.) in your private network and access it from the web from anywhere where you are!
